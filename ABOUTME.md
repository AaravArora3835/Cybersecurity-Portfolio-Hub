# About Aarav Arora

## Introduction

Hi, Iâ€™m **Aarav Arora**, a high-school sophomore with a deep passion for cybersecurity and technology.  
Iâ€™m currently on a **44-week journey (Oct 2025 â€“ Aug 2026)** to build professional-level cybersecurity skills through certifications, hands-on projects, and community education.  
This portfolio documents my growth from a student to a future security professional, and goes one week at a time.

## Why Cybersecurity?

Iâ€™ve always been drawn to the idea of helping people and solving problems that make a real difference.  
As I learned more about how much of our lives exist online, I realized that millions of people use technology every day without understanding how to stay safe.  
Cybersecurity became the perfect way for me to combine my curiosity for technology with my desire to protect and empower others.  

I want to make cybersecurity **clear, approachable, and human**, and not something intimidating or hidden behind jargon.  
Thatâ€™s why I created **SecureScholar**, a gamified cybersecurity learning platform designed to teach students like me the fundamentals of digital safety in an engaging way.  
Through projects, workshops, and open documentation, my goal is to help others feel confident and secure in the digital world.

By August 2026, I aim to have **three certifications**, a **live educational platform**, and **community workshops** that teach real online safety skills to 50+ people.
