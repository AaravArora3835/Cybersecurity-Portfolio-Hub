## Learning Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Document Everything**
   - Public accountability drives consistency
   - Future reference for myself and others
   - Proof of work for college/internship applications

2. **Build in Public**
   - Share progress, failures, and lessons
   - Transparency > perfection
   - Learn from community feedback

3. **Quality Over Speed**
   - Deep understanding > rushing through material
   - Master fundamentals before advanced topics
   - It's a 10-month journey, not a sprint

4. **Community Focus**
   - Use skills to help others (workshops)
   - Give back while learning
   - Teaching reinforces understanding

5. **Sustainable Pace**
   - 5-8 hrs/week during school year
   - 15-18 hrs/week during summer
   - Balance with academics and life
   - Consistency > intensity
