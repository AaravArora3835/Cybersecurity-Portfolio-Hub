## Portfolio Overview

This portfolio demonstrates my progression in cybersecurity through hands-on projects, professional certifications, and community education. Every project is documented with evidence, reflections, and lessons learned.

**Why This Matters:**  
Rather than passively consuming courses, I'm building real applications, configuring security infrastructure, and teaching others—proving I can apply knowledge to solve actual problems.

## Documentation Philosophy

Every project in this portfolio follows professional standards:

✅ **Clear Objectives** – What am I trying to accomplish?  
✅ **Methodology** – Step-by-step technical process  
✅ **Evidence** – Screenshots, logs, code samples  
✅ **Analysis** – What did I learn? What went wrong?  
✅ **Reflection** – How does this connect to larger goals?

This approach mirrors real-world security assessments and technical reporting, preparing me for professional environments.
