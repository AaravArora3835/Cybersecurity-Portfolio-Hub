# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about my cybersecurity journey, projects, and goals.

---

## About the Journey

### Why are you building this in public?
**Accountability and transparency.** Public documentation keeps me honest about progress, forces me to explain concepts clearly, and creates a portfolio that proves my skills with evidence rather than claims.

### Why 44 weeks specifically?
**Timeline:** October 2025 (start of roadmap) to August 2026 (before junior year). This gives me a complete portfolio for college applications and summer 2027 internship opportunities.

### How do you balance this with high school?
**5-8 hours per week during school year, 15-18 hours during summer.** I treat this like an honors course—scheduled study blocks, consistent weekly goals, and flexible pacing when academic workload is heavy.

### What if you fall behind schedule?
**School comes first.** If academics suffer, I'll reduce to certification-only focus. The roadmap has built-in flexibility (certifications can extend 2-4 weeks without impacting later phases).

## About SecureScholar

### What is SecureScholar?
**Gamified cybersecurity learning platform for high school students.** Interactive modules teach password security, phishing detection, encryption basics, and more through quizzes, points, badges, and leaderboards.

### Why build a learning platform instead of just taking courses?
**Three reasons:**
1. Teaching others reinforces my own understanding
2. Demonstrates full-stack development skills (not just security theory)
3. Creates real impact—helping peers learn digital safety

### What's your target user count?
**300+ registered users by August 2026.** Starting with friends, classmates, then expanding through school clubs and social media outreach.

### Is SecureScholar open-source?
**Yes.** All code is public on GitHub. Anyone can fork, modify, or learn from it.

## About Certifications

### Why these three certifications specifically?
**Progressive difficulty and industry recognition:**
- **Google Cert:** Foundational knowledge, beginner-friendly
- **ISC² CC:** Vendor-neutral principles, free certification
- **Security+:** Industry standard, required by many employers/internships

### How much do the certifications cost?
- **Google Cybersecurity:** $49/month on Coursera (~$150 total if completed in 3 months)
- **ISC² CC:** Free (limited-time free exam voucher program)
- **CompTIA Security+:** ~$370 exam fee (student discount available)

**Total Investment:** ~$520

### What if you fail an exam?
**Built-in buffer time.** Each phase has 1-2 extra weeks for retakes if needed. Security+ is scheduled early enough that a retake fits before August deadline.

### Do you need certifications to get into cybersecurity?
**No, but they help significantly.** Certifications validate knowledge for entry-level positions and internships. Combined with hands-on projects (SecureScholar, home lab), they make my portfolio competitive.

## About the Home Lab

### What's in your home lab?
**VirtualBox environment with:**
- Windows 10 VM (target system)
- Kali Linux VM (attacker platform)
- Dual-NIC networking (NAT + Host-Only for isolation)

**Future additions:** Metasploitable, Ubuntu Server, Windows Server (Active Directory)

### Why use virtual machines instead of physical hardware?
**Cost and safety.** VMs are free, isolated from real networks, and snapshots allow instant rollback if I break something. Perfect for learning destructive techniques safely.

### Can others replicate your lab?
**Yes—full documentation in the [Cybersecurity-Homelab repo](https://github.com/AaravArora3835/Cybersecurity-Homelab).** Step-by-step guides, screenshots, and troubleshooting logs make it repeatable.

## About Community Impact

### What are the Digital Safety Kit workshops?
**Free community workshops teaching practical cybersecurity to students and parents.** Topics include password security, phishing recognition, 2FA setup, and social media privacy.

**Goal:** 50+ participants across 2-3 sessions by August 2026.

### Why focus on community education?
**Two reasons:**
1. Cybersecurity knowledge shouldn't be gatekept—everyone deserves digital safety skills
2. Teaching deepens my own understanding and develops communication skills

### How will you measure workshop impact?
**Pre/post surveys:** Participants rate their confidence in each topic before and after. Anonymous feedback helps improve future sessions.

## Technical Questions

### What programming languages do you know?
**Currently:**
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (intermediate—building SecureScholar)
- Python (beginner—learning through Google Cert)
- Bash scripting (beginner—home lab automation)

**Learning next:** Python for security automation, SQL for database security

### What's your favorite security tool?
**Nmap.** It's powerful yet beginner-friendly, teaches networking fundamentals, and is used in real penetration tests. First tool I mastered in my home lab.

### What's the hardest part of cybersecurity so far?
**Networking concepts.** Understanding subnets, firewalls, and packet flow took repeated practice. Home lab helped tremendously—breaking and fixing things is how I learned.

---

## College & Career

### What do you want to study in college?
**Cybersecurity or Computer Science major.** Targeting schools with strong security programs and research opportunities.

### What's your dream job?
**Penetration tester or red team member.** I love the offensive side—finding vulnerabilities before attackers do. Long-term goal is security architecture or research.

### When are you looking for internships?
**Summer 2027 (after junior year).** This portfolio will be complete by August 2026, giving me a full year to apply with proven skills.

### Do you want to work in cybersecurity long-term?
**Absolutely.** The field combines problem-solving, continuous learning, and real-world impact. Every day there are new threats to defend against—I'll never be bored.

## About This Portfolio

### Can I use your templates/structure for my own portfolio?
**Yes—everything is public and free to use.** If it helps someone else get started in cybersecurity, that's a win. Just please don't copy-paste my personal story.

### How do you stay motivated for 10 months?
**Three tactics:**
1. **Public accountability** (this GitHub portfolio)
2. **Weekly wins** (small accomplishments documented each week)
3. **Community feedback** (engagement from others learning alongside me)

### What happens after August 2026?
**Next phase:**
- Apply for internships (summer 2027)
- Continue SecureScholar growth and feature expansion
- Begin college application process with complete portfolio
- Explore advanced certifications (CEH, OSCP)
- Mentor other students entering cybersecurity
