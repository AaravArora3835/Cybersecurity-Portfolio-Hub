## Contingency Planning

### If I Fall Behind Schedule
**Academic Priorities:** School comes first. If grades slip, reduce to certification-only focus.

**Certification Delays:**
- Google Cert: Can extend to January if needed (Phase 2 starts late)
- ISC² CC: Can compress to 6 weeks if necessary (content overlap with Google Cert)
- Security+: Non-negotiable deadline (exam scheduled and paid for)

**Project Scaling:**
- SecureScholar: Minimum viable product = 3 modules + basic gamification
- Workshops: Can reduce to 1 session if time-constrained (still meet 50+ participant goal with larger venue)

### If I Get Ahead of Schedule
**Advanced Topics:**
- Add Python automation projects (security tool development)
- Expand home lab with Active Directory setup
- Begin OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional) preparation
- Contribute to open-source security tools

---

## Weekly Time Allocation

### School Year (Oct - May)
**Total:** 5-8 hours/week

- **Certifications:** 3-4 hours (study, labs, quizzes)
- **SecureScholar:** 2-3 hours (development, content creation)
- **Community/Admin:** 1 hour (documentation, planning)

### Summer Break (Jun - Aug)
**Total:** 15-18 hours/week

- **Security+ Prep:** 8-10 hours (intensive study)
- **SecureScholar Launch:** 5-6 hours (final polish, marketing)
- **Workshops:** 2-3 hours (delivery, refinement)

---

## Risk Management

### Potential Challenges
1. **Burnout Risk:** Long-term commitment with school pressure
   - Mitigation: Built-in breaks, flexible weekly hours, quality over speed

2. **Technical Blockers:** Complex topics or tool issues
   - Mitigation: Active in Discord/Reddit communities, mentor network, documentation-first approach

3. **Motivation Dips:** Natural over 10 months
   - Mitigation: Public accountability, weekly wins tracking, community feedback

4. **Scope Creep:** SecureScholar feature additions
   - Mitigation: Strict phase deliverables, MVP mindset, user feedback loops
